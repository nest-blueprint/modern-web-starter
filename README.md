# Nest Blueprint: Modern Web Starter

Welcome to **Nest Blueprint: Modern Web Starter** - an exemplary project template designed to kickstart your journey
into modern web application development with Nest.js. This project embodies the pinnacle of software craftsmanship,
integrating advanced patterns and practices such as Sequelize, Auth0 authentication, CQRS pattern, Clean Architecture,
Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber, unit testing, decorators, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and more.

Our aim is to provide a comprehensive, ready-to-use Nest.js project skeleton that not only accelerates the development
process for new projects but also serves as a learning framework for best practices in the industry.

## Features
